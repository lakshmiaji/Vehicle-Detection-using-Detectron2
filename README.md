# Vehicle Detection using Detectron2



Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research (FAIR)â€™s most widely adopted new vision library that allows us to easily use and create object detection, instance segmentation, keypoint detection and panoptic segmentation models. 

I used Faster RCNN model for object detection and implemented it on Delhi traffic video.
