# Vehicle Detection using Detectron2
This repository includes detecting vehicles using Faster RCNN Detectron2 model from real-time traffic videos.

## Detectron2
Object detection is a tremendous job especially when you are trying to build a custom object detector. For those, Detectron2 is here which is flexible, extensible and super easy to work on.
Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research (FAIR)â€™s most widely adopted new vision library that allows us to easily use and create object detection, instance segmentation, keypoint detection and panoptic segmentation models. 

I used Faster RCNN model for object detection and implemented it on Delhi traffic video.

## Conclusion
For a real time video, the results are super accurate.
